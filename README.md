# The Hitchhiker's Guide to NSCC
Surprisingly, not a lot of people know that Singaporean university students are entitled to quite a substantial amount of compute for their personal projects. High probability that this is because the platform (NSCC) has a very steep learning curve, (not to mention the official guide is sometimes indecipherable). This blog is meant to provide a comprehensive guide, so you too can use NSCC like a pro!

1. [Logging in to NSCC](/Logging%20in%20to%20NSCC.md) (Create an account, jumphost, VSCode integration)
2. [Setting up an environment](/Setting%20up%20an%20environment.md)
3. [Transferring files](/Transferring%20files.md) (SCP, git, drag & drop)
4. [Submitting jobs](/Submitting%20jobs.md)
5. [Running jupyter-notebooks](/Running%20jupyter-notebooks.md)
6. [SSH tunnelling](/SSH%20tunnelling.md)
7. [Trick to save space](/Trick%20to%20save%20space.md)
8. [Accessing the compute node of a running job](/Accessing%20the%20compute%20node%20of%20a%20running%20job.md)
9. [Min-maxing the queue](/Min-maxing%20the%20queue.md)

PS: I use a MacBook, so the guide will be written from the perspective of a MacOS user. For other operating systems, 99% of the stuff is the same, only some of step 1 + step 3 will be slightly different. I recommend you to check out [this guide](https://github.com/16fb/NSCC-Guide), which is specific for Windows users.
