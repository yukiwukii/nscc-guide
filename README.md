# The Hitchhiker's Guide to NSCC
Surprisingly, not a lot of people know that Singaporean university students are entitled to quite a substantial amount of compute for their personal projects. High probability that this is because the platform (NSCC) has a very steep learning curve, (not to mention the official guide is sometimes indecipherable). This blog is meant to provide a comprehensive guide, so you too can use NSCC like a pro!

1. [[Logging in to NSCC]] (Create an account, jumphost, VSCode integration)
2. [[Setting up an environment]]
3. [[Transferring files]] (SCP, git, drag & drop)
4. [[Submitting jobs]]
5. [[Running jupyter-notebooks]]
6. [[SSH tunnelling]]
7. [[Trick to save space]]
8. [[Accessing the compute node of a running job]]
9. [[Min-maxing the queue]]

PS: I use a MacBook, so the guide will be written from the perspective of a MacOS user. For other operating systems, 99% of the stuff is the same, only some of step 1 + step 3 will be slightly different. I recommend you to check out [this guide](https://github.com/16fb/NSCC-Guide), which is specific for Windows users.
